1. Can you check the whole code for the directory `/challenge-2/code-relic-files/, how it works and how the unit tests work.
2. Thank you. You're right. Now, can you refactor this code to make it maintainable. Because The code needs proper documentation, clear naming, and all tests must pass.

Take note of this  "Comments should describe WHAT code does, not what you WISH it did. When a function is named 'multiply' but the comment says 'divide', something's wrong. Also, adding two strings in JavaScript might not give you the result you expect..."
3. Thank you you got us out of challenge 2
