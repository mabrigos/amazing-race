# Setup
group = "group-1"
challenge = "challenge-1"

# Instructions
From now on, record every prompt and question I ask you — except this setup prompt — into the file:
`${group}/${challenge}/prompts.md`

Each entry should follow this format:

1. <my prompt here>
2. <next prompt>
3. <and so on...>

Continue numbering sequentially.
Append new entries to the bottom of the file (do not overwrite existing content).

If a developer is working on a different group or challenge, they only need to edit the two variables above.

Confirm that recording has started and that this setup prompt is not logged.
