# end goal
- fix comments that mismatch our functions - e.g. group-3/challenge-2/utils/calc.js
- fix unit tests such as
  ``test("multiply should divide numbers", () => {
    expect(multiply(10, 2)).toBe(5); // ‚ùå wrong expectation
  });``
- code should still be the same unless explicitly tasked to do so

put comments on these files as well on what the codes actually does for proper documentation
