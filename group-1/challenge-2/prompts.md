1. ASK - The code needs proper documentation, clear naming, and all tests must pass.

this is the hint provided: Comments should describe WHAT code does, not what you WISH it did. When a function is named 'multiply' but the comment says 'divide', something's wrong. Also, adding two strings in JavaScript might not give you the result you expect.

2. Ask - can you explain the error and provide the proposed fix accordingly

3. Agent - apply the proposed fix accordingly

4. Agent - add proper documentation in readme.md and rerun the test.

5. Agent - one of the tests still failed, the 2nd test where the string should be parsed to int wasn't added properly. adjust the actual function and re run the test

also ensure this is added in the docu.
