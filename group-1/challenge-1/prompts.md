1. I'm working on Challenge 1: Bug Hunt - a Node.js debugging exercise where I need to fix a broken todo fetcher that's supposed to pull completed tasks from JSONPlaceholder API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos). 
2. The tests are currently failing. Can you help me understand the test requirements first before we start fixing bugs? Please read the test file and explain what the tests are checking for - specifically:
3. Now that I understand the test requirements, let's systematically identify all bugs in the codebase by comparing the current implementation against what the tests expect.
4. Don't fix anything yet - I want a complete diagnostic first so we can tackle fixes in the right order.
5. Let's start with the bugs that would cause the application to crash or throw errors at runtime.
6. Now let's fix the logic bugs that cause incorrect output. The tests are failing because the data returned doesn't match expectations.
7. With all functional bugs fixed, let's clean up code quality issues to make the codebase maintainable:
8. Let's do a final review of the fixed codebase to ensure it's production-ready
