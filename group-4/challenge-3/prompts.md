You are a senior software engineer with data engineering specialty. Currently, the app is failing. Testing this can be ran using npm test. Also, before testing, the app needs data cleaning which must be run first via npm run transform. The script for transformation is ready to be implemented with the needed functions already exported, kindly implement those for me.

Your task is to implement these functions to ensure the data is cleaned properly and the application works as expected.
