1. You're a prompt engineering expert in recreating site. Help me make a prompt that I can use to recreate a landing page. Note that I can only use description and cannot take in images to recreate. My current specifications are:

Header should have title named SnackQuest with a svg logo on the left side and 4 menu links (Home, Challenges, Leaderboard, About) with Login and a Dark Mode button with icon on the right side.

First section is Hero, with a text Welcome to the Amazing AI Race with sub text below "Can you out-prompt the machine?" and a Start Now Button.

Next section is a to enumerate challenges with Challenges Preview as the title (centered) with subtext "Five sample missions to test your creative coding and prompting finesse." Below it, are list of challenges, aligned horizontally using cards in a flexbox that is flex wrapped from left to right. Challenge contents are icon, challenge <number>, Description. These are the items:

🎯
Challenge 1
Sharpen percision prompts to guide AI output with minimal tokens

🔧
Challenge 2
Engineer a toolchain that transforms vague tasks into structured specs.

🌐
Challenge 3
Leverage multilingual hints to unlock hidden model capabilities.

🔄️
Challenge 4
Iteratively refine outputs via self-reflection & structured critique.

📖
Challenge 5
Summarize complex narratives into concise, testable bullet logic.

Next section, is entitled Leaderboard with subtext "Top teams blazing through the Amazing AI Race", with a table with a container with padding. It has these columns: Rank, Team Name, Score.

Values in CSV format are:

🥇1, The Prompt Lords, 98
🥈2, Null Terminators, 87
🥉3, Snack Overflow, 73

Below it is a section with title 'About the Race' with description "The Amazing AI Race is a playful coding & prompting completion celebrating creativity, iteration, and clever constraint bending. Ship novel ideas, optimize instructions, and collaborate with teammates to climb the board. Snack options--but recommended.

Footer has a text in the middle "Built with Copilot 💻. Powered by Snacks 🍫."
