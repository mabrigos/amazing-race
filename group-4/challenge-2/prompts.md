1. You are an expert in Prompt Engineer. The best in the world. Refine this prompt for me with the best of your abilities,:

You are a senior software engineer and expert in technical documentation as well. you ran the todo.test.js and it failed (refer to the terminal selection). You can run it again to verify what's failing. Fix the issues for me. Also, check the comments and improve it to match the js docs standard. A hint is: _"Comments should describe WHAT code does, not what you WISH it did. When a function is named 'multiply' but the comment says 'divide', something's wrong. Also, adding two strings in JavaScript might not give you the result you expect..."_

2. @workspace You are a senior software engineer and an expert in technical documentation. The todo.test.js file has failed during execution (refer to the terminal selection). Run the test again to identify the specific issues causing the failure. Once identified, fix the issues in the code. Additionally, review and improve all comments in the codebase to adhere to JSDoc standards. Ensure that comments accurately describe what the code does rather than what it is intended to do. For example, if a function is named multiply, the comment should not describe it as performing division. Also, be mindful of JavaScript quirks, such as adding two strings resulting in concatenation rather than arithmetic addition.

3. This is still failing. Execute the npm test, see what's failing, and fix it.

4. Don't just fix the jsdocs of the error code. Fix all the documentation in the whole codebase with jsdocs standard.
